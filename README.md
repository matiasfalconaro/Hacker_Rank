# HackerRank Challenge Solutions

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to various Python programming challenges on HackerRank. The main purpose of this repository is to track my progress and keep a record of my solutions to these challenges. Feel free to explore the solutions and use them for reference.

## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository is intentionally designed to encourage self-challenge and minimize the temptation to immediately refer to the solutions. It is set up as follows:

- `1_tasks/`: Holds the challenge descriptions, similarly organized by difficulty.
  - `1_tasks_easy/`: Markdown files describing easy challenges.
    - `1_tasks_introduction`: Markdown files describing introduction challenges.
    - `2_tasks_basic_data_types`
    - `3_tasks_strings`
    - `4_tasks_sets`
    - `5_tasks_math`
    - `6_tasks_itertools`
    - `7_tasks_collections`
    - `8_tasks_data_and_time`
    - `9_tasks_errores_and_exceptions`
    - `10_tasks_classes`
    - `11_tasks_built_ins`
    - `12_tasks_python_functionals`
    - `13_tasks_regex_and_parsing`
    - `14_tasks_xml`
    - `15_tasks_closures_and_decorators`
    - `16_tasks_numpy`
  - `2_tasks_medium/`: Markdown files for medium challenges.
  - `3_tasks_hard/`: Markdown files for hard challenges.

- `2_solutions/`: Contains all solution files, organized by difficulty.
  - `1_solutions_easy/`: Solutions for easy challenges.
    - `1_solutions_introduction`
    - `2_solution_basic_data_types`
    - `3_solutions_strings`
    - `4_solutions_sets`
    - `5_solutions_math`
    - `6_solutions_itertools`
    - `7_solutions_collections`
    - `8_solutions_data_and_time`
    - `9_solutions_errores_and_exceptions`
    - `10_solutions_classes`
    - `11_solutions_built_ins`
    - `12_solutions_python_functionals`
    - `13_solutions_regex_and_parsing`
    - `14_solutions_xml`
    - `15_solutions_closures_and_decorators`
    - `16_solutions_numpy`
  - `2_solutions_medium`: Solutions for medium challenges.
  - `3_solutions_hard`: Solutions for hard challenges.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies required for the solutions.

## How to Use
1. **Start with Tasks**: Begin by exploring the `tasks/` directory. Select a difficulty level and read through the challenge descriptions. This approach encourages you to understand and attempt the problem independently.

2. **Attempt Solutions on Your Own**: Before checking the provided solutions, try to solve the challenges by yourself. This practice enhances your problem-solving skills and deepens your understanding.

3. **Refer to Solutions When Needed**: Solutions are available but placed in a separate directory to avoid easy access and encourage a try-first approach. If you're stuck or want to compare approaches after attempting the problem, navigate to the corresponding `solutions/` directory.

4. **Run and Compare**: Use the `requirements.txt` file to install any necessary dependencies and run the solutions. Compare your approach to the provided solutions for additional learning and insight.

This repository's layout is aimed at fostering a learning environment where you are motivated to push your limits and develop your skills without immediately resorting to the solutions.
