# HackerRank Challenge Solutions

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to various Python programming challenges on HackerRank. The main purpose of this repository is to track my progress and keep a record of my solutions to these challenges. Feel free to explore the solutions and use them for reference.

## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository is intentionally designed to encourage self-challenge and minimize the temptation to immediately refer to the solutions. It is set up as follows:

- `solutions/`: Contains all solution files, organized by difficulty.
  - `solutions_easy/`: Solutions for easy challenges (e.g., `1_say_hello_world_with_python.py`).
  - `solutions_medium/`: Solutions for medium challenges.
  - `solutions_hard/`: Solutions for hard challenges.

- `tasks/`: Holds the challenge descriptions, similarly organized by difficulty.
  - `tasks_easy/`: Markdown files describing easy challenges (e.g., `1_say_hello_world_with_python.md`).
  - `tasks_medium/`: Markdown files for medium challenges.
  - `tasks_hard/`: Markdown files for hard challenges.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies required for the solutions.

## How to Use
1. **Start with Tasks**: Begin by exploring the `tasks/` directory. Select a difficulty level and read through the challenge descriptions. This approach encourages you to understand and attempt the problem independently.

2. **Attempt Solutions on Your Own**: Before checking the provided solutions, try to solve the challenges by yourself. This practice enhances your problem-solving skills and deepens your understanding.

3. **Refer to Solutions When Needed**: Solutions are available but placed in a separate directory to avoid easy access and encourage a try-first approach. If you're stuck or want to compare approaches after attempting the problem, navigate to the corresponding `solutions/` directory.

4. **Run and Compare**: Use the `requirements.txt` file to install any necessary dependencies and run the solutions. Compare your approach to the provided solutions for additional learning and insight.

This repository's layout is aimed at fostering a learning environment where you are motivated to push your limits and develop your skills without immediately resorting to the solutions.

## Contributing
While this repository is primarily for my personal use, if you find any errors or have suggestions for alternative solutions, feel free to create an issue or a pull request.
