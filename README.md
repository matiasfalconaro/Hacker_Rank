# HackerRank Challenge Solutions

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to various Python programming challenges on HackerRank. The main purpose of this repository is to track my progress and keep a record of my solutions to these challenges. Feel free to explore the solutions and use them for reference.

## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository is intentionally designed to encourage self-challenge and minimize the temptation to immediately refer to the solutions. It is set up as follows:

- `solutions/`: Contains all solution files, organized by difficulty.
  - `solutions_easy/`: Solutions for easy challenges.
    - `solutions_introduction`
    - `solution_basic_data_types`
    - `solutions_strings`
    - `solutions_sets`
    - `solutions_math`
    - `solutions_itertools`
    - `solutions_collections`
    - `solutions_data_and_time`
    - `solutions_errores_and_exceptions`
    - `solutions_classes`
    - `solutions_built_ins`
    - `solutions_python_functionals`
    - `solutions_regex_and_parsing`
    - `solutions_xml`
    - `solutions_closures_and_decorators`
    - `solutions_numpy`
  - `solutions_medium`: Solutions for medium challenges.
  - `solutions_hard`: Solutions for hard challenges.

- `tasks/`: Holds the challenge descriptions, similarly organized by difficulty.
  - `tasks_easy/`: Markdown files describing easy challenges.
    - `tasks_introduction`: Markdown files describing introduction challenges.
    - `tasks_strings`
    - `tasks_sets`
    - `tasks_math`
    - `tasks_itertools`
    - `tasks_collections`
    - `tasks_data_and_time`
    - `tasks_errores_and_exceptions`
    - `tasks_classes`
    - `tasks_built_ins`
    - `tasks_python_functionals`
    - `tasks_regex_and_parsing`
    - `tasks_xml`
    - `tasks_closures_and_decorators`
    - `tasks_numpy`
  - `tasks_medium/`: Markdown files for medium challenges.
  - `tasks_hard/`: Markdown files for hard challenges.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies required for the solutions.

## How to Use
1. **Start with Tasks**: Begin by exploring the `tasks/` directory. Select a difficulty level and read through the challenge descriptions. This approach encourages you to understand and attempt the problem independently.

2. **Attempt Solutions on Your Own**: Before checking the provided solutions, try to solve the challenges by yourself. This practice enhances your problem-solving skills and deepens your understanding.

3. **Refer to Solutions When Needed**: Solutions are available but placed in a separate directory to avoid easy access and encourage a try-first approach. If you're stuck or want to compare approaches after attempting the problem, navigate to the corresponding `solutions/` directory.

4. **Run and Compare**: Use the `requirements.txt` file to install any necessary dependencies and run the solutions. Compare your approach to the provided solutions for additional learning and insight.

This repository's layout is aimed at fostering a learning environment where you are motivated to push your limits and develop your skills without immediately resorting to the solutions.
